<p>a. The for loop has a capital F, it is an infinite loop as the number is being incremented starting from 100.</p>
<p>b. There is no break in each case.</p>
<p>c. It should be -= instead of += as it is outputing odd integers from 19 to 1.</p>
<p>d. The while should be all lowercase, and it should be <= 100 if it is including 100.</p>
